"""
    Vega(name::String = "alpha_lyr_stis_011")
Loads the reference spectrum with filename `name` and returns it as an instance of `Vega`.

If the provided `name` is the full path to the existing file on disk, the spectrum is loaded from that file. Otherwise, it is downloaded from the [CALSPEC database]($calspec_url) of standard stars maintained by STScI and cached for future use. Specifically, we draw from the extended catalog [here](https://ssb.stsci.edu/cdbs/calspec/). Standard Vega spectra start with `"alpha_lyr"`. `name`s like `"alpha_lyr_stis_XXX"` are based on composites of calibrated stellar models and HST/STIS data, while `"alpha_lyr_mod_XXX"` are based on stellar models only.

Sometimes Vega is not used as the standard star for photometric systems even when the system follows the Vega magnitude convention. For example, in the near-IR Sirius is often used as the standard reference spectrum rather than Vega. This is the case for the definition of the [JWST zeropoints](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-camera/nircam-performance/nircam-absolute-flux-calibration-and-zeropoints#gsc.tab=0), which presently use the `"sirius_stis_005.fits"` CALSPEC spectrum as their standard. To load a different standard, simply provide the corresponding `name` to `Vega`. For example, to load the Sirius spectrum, use `Vega("sirius_stis_005")`.
