# PhotometricFilters

This package provides access to, and operations on, photometric filter curves. Such filter curves are defined by a filter's transmission as a function of wavelength. Transmission and wavelength vectors are therefore the foundation of a filter curve, but it is also important to note whether the filter is used for photon counter or energy counter detectors, as the integrals used to calculate statistics over a filter curve are different between these two types of detectors.

## Types

We use the [`PhotometricFilter`](@ref) type to represent photometric filters in this package.

```@docs
PhotometricFilter
```

Users can construct their own filter curvers from raw data using this type.

## Accessing Filter Curves

We provide a modest collection of filter curves through a data dependency. The available filter curves are accessible via the `FILTER_NAMES` module constant,

```@example 1
using PhotometricFilters
PhotometricFilters.FILTER_NAMES |> println
```

These included filter curves can be accessed like so,
```@example 1
using PhotometricFilters: SDSS_u, SDSS_g, SDSS_r, SDSS_i, SDSS_z, fwhm
filts = [SDSS_u(), SDSS_g(), SDSS_r(), SDSS_i(), SDSS_z()]
```

**NOTE THAT THESE INCLUDED FILTER CURVES ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE UP-TO-DATE.** If you are using a filter/instrument that may have recently had its filter curves updated (e.g., JWST/NIRCAM), you should use our SVO query interface to make sure you get the most up-to-date filter curves. If you know the SVO-designated name of the filter you want, you can use [`get_filter`](@ref) to retrieve its transmission data, which returns an instance of [`PhotometricFilter`](@ref).

```@docs
get_filter
```

If you'd like to perform a search on the filters available through the SVO filter service, you can use [`query_filters`](@ref).

```@docs
query_filters
```
